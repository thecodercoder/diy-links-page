        <h2>About me </h2>

        <p class="p_styles" >I'm Moinul Khan, or Manny for short, a high school graduate with a passion for web development and a growing interest in Full Stack Development. Beyond my technical skills, I run a contracting company where I offer video editing and photography services, allowing me to explore my creative side.

            I thrive on collaboration and am eager to work together with talented individuals. My journey has been one of continuous learning and exploration, as I seek to discover my true path and the people who will shape my future endeavors.
            
            With a deep sense of curiosity and a growth mindset, I look forward to the exciting experiences and connections that the future holds. I would love to collaborate and contribute to meaningful projects together.
